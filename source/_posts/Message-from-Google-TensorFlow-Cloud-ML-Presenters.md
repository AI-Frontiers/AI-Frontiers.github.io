Dear Tutorial Attendee:

Thank you so much for attending Google's "TensorFlow on Cloud ML" tutorial at AI Frontiers!

We had a blast and appreciated everyone's enthusiasm and patience with setup!

An important reminder: In order to avoid future charges to your billing account, please shut down any resources you created during the training. If you're unfamiliar with turning off Google Compute Engine instances and Cloud ML jobs, we suggest you go to the Projects section of Cloud Console, select your project, and click Delete Project.

We're interested in your feedback! If you can spare a minute, please send a note to ai-frontiers-feedback@google.com and let us know what you think:
What did you like about the tutorial?
How can we improve it in the future?
Tell us about your experience with ML and TensorFlow prior to the AI Frontiers tutorial
Sincerely,

Your Google TensorFlow / Cloud ML Presenters and Teaching Assistants
